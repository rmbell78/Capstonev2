# Super life simulator 3000

This project was created with the idea to make a game like Rimworld, one of my favorite games. 
Working on the project made me realize just how much goes into making a game like that. Check out their steam page [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/)

My goal was to create a simple life simulator that required you to manage your people, pawns, to ensure they have enough food while 
also gathering enough resources to expand your colony. There was a lot more I wanted to implement but quickly realized the scope of doing 
these things was way out of my range for now.

Right now you have a group of people that you manage, they all require housing and food and by acquiring wood you can create more houses which in turn lets you create more people.
There is no end game or goal really, but you can carry on as long as you want. Its quite fun to watch all the little people move around the map.
